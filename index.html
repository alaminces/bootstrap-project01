				<p>Muhammad was born approximately 570 CE in Mecca.[1] He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father Abdullah was the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and he died a few months before Muhammad's birth. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan.[7] He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib.[8] In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave[1][9] and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613,[10] Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly,[11] proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islam) to God[12] is the right way of life (din),[13] and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.[14][15][16]</p>
